# üõ°Ô∏è Cortex XSIAM ‚Äì CrowdStrike Falcon Integration Setup

Enhances the native CrowdStrike Falcon integration in Cortex XSIAM with tailored layouts, automation support, dashboards, and correlation rules to improve threat visibility and SOC response efficiency.

---

## üöÄ Configuration Steps

### 1. Layout Rule (Recommended)

- Use condition: `tags contains "DS:CrowdStrike"`
- Designed for correlation alerts; compatible with FDR-based alerts (BIOCs/Analytics)
- **Note:** First alert must be ingested before DS tag can be used in a rule

---

### 2. Playbook Trigger (Recommended)

- Use condition: `tags = "DS:CrowdStrike_xxx"`
- Triggers enrichment and response playbooks
- **Note:** DS tag must exist before the trigger rule can be created

---

### 3. Correlation Rule Strategy

- **Option 1:** 12 MITRE tactic-specific rules (granular visibility, harder to manage at scale)
- **Option 2:** 2 simplified rules (EDR/EPP and IDP events; IDP currently lacks MITRE mapping)

---

### 4. Dashboards

- Compatible with XSIAM 2.x
- Update drilldown link on **CrowdStrike Alert Table** to match your tenant for alert navigation
- **Note:** Some widgets may not function as intended on XSIAM 3.x due to dataset changes

## ‚úÖ Integration Complete

CrowdStrike Falcon telemetry is now optimized for correlation, investigation, and response within Cortex XSIAM.
